# ðŸ’« About Me:
I'm a detail-oriented problem solver who enjoys challenges and is always curious about new things. With experience in both collaborative and independent development, I'm skilled at discussing technical choices and architecture design with team members and putting them into practice. I continuously improve my skills through self-learning and developing Side Projects, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. Throughout the development process, I prioritize code quality and readability, and I write maintainable code and tests to reduce technical debt.
